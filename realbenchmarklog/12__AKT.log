----Intermediate nodes-----
{'MEK1_2', 'ERBB1', 'mTOR', 'ERBB2', 'ERK1_2', 'PKCa', 'p70S6K', 'ERBB3', 'PLCg', 'PDK1'}
Now arrange layout of the original network for visualization
Sorted input names
['EGF', 'HRG', 'erlotinib', 'pertuzumab', 'trastuzumab']
There are 5 inputs with the range of input: 0 31
Sorted internames:
['ERBB1', 'ERBB2', 'ERBB3', 'ERK1_2', 'MEK1_2', 'PDK1', 'PKCa', 'PLCg', 'mTOR', 'p70S6K']
There are 10 intermediate nodes with the range of inter: 0 1023
